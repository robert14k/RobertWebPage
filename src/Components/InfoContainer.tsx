              About Me:
            </Row>
            <Row>
              I am a senior at UNL studying software engineering with minors in
              business and mathematics. This past summer, I had an opportunity
              to be a software development intern at Hudl in Lincoln. I worked
              with a talented team of full-time engineers on their payment and 
              subscription management related micro-services. I was able to use
              the knowledge I had gained in class about scrum and agile, and 
              apply it to my work at Hudl. Over the course of the two summers 
              prior, I interned at Buildertrend and Northrop Grumman. This school 
              year I am excited to be an associate member of the Raikes School
              Design Studio Program.
              <p/> 
              Outside of school, I am a brother of Phi Kappa Theta
              Fraternity, an active member of the Newman Center on campus, and
              an avid Husker football fan. This summer I married my highschool
              sweetheart and am excited to explore the world with her. Speaking
              of exploring the world, I love to travel; I spent this past Christmas
              break in India and can now check the Taj Mahal off my list!  With my 
              spare time, I play and listen to music, read books while sipping 
              coffee, and I am working on building a full-stack web app with a
              React.js and Apollo front-end and a Python and GraphQL back-end.

            </Row>
            <Row>
              Iâ€™m a sophomore at UNL studying software engineering with minors
              in business and mathematics. During the school year, I work as a
              Learning assistant for the computer science II class at UNL which
              is helping me to better my understanding of the Java programming
              language. This summer I am a software development intern at
              Buildertrend in Omaha. <p />I am the secretary and serve on the
              executive board of Phi Kappa Theta fraternity, an active member of
              the Newman Center on campus, and an avid Husker football fan. I am
              excited by new technologies and want to learn about the different
              disciplines of software and hardware engineering. With my spare
              time, I play and listen to music, and I am starting to learn and
              build an application in the JavaScript programming language.
